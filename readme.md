# Next.js with Express.js Combined Code

This project combines Next.js, a React framework for frontend development, with Express.js for building a backend server. The project structure includes the `server` folder for the backend with an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, and the `pages` folder for the frontend.

## Project Structure

- `server/`: This folder contains the backend code. It follows the MVC architecture, which is a common pattern for organizing server-side code.

  - `controllers/`: Controllers handle the application's logic and interact with models and views.

- `pages/`: This folder contains the frontend code. Next.js uses this folder to automatically create routes and render React components on the client side.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shylesh128/nextjswithexpress.git
   cd <project-folder>
   ```
