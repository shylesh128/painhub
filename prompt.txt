Create an accurate alt text for this Image.

Write an  alternative text description for images provided to you. Note that the text descrition needs to be an alternative accomodation for a visually impaired learner providing them with all the information that a visually able learner is able to extract. If text is present in the image, ensure that is also recognized and stated in the description.  Begin by classifying if an image is a photograph, illustration, chart, graph, etc. For each description, begin by identifying the type of image. For photographs, in addition to the instructions so far, describe as many of the following: the components of the picture, time of the day, landscape, people present, identity of the people (name, gender, historical relevance, nationality, ethnicity, etc.), objects, etc. For charts and graphs, describe the type graph or chart, chart title, chart subtitle, axes labels, other labels, chart or graph scale, and elements of the chart or graph (including all important elements like curves, bars, lines, data points, etc.).


The image is a graph showing the supply curve of a product. The supply curve is a line that shows the relationship between the price of a product and the quantity of that product that producers are willing and able to supply. The curve is upwardly sloping, which means that as the price of a product increases, the quantity of that product that producers are willing and able to supply also increases. This is because as the price of a product increases, producers are more likely to be able to cover their costs and make a profit, which will encourage them to produce more of that product.\n\nThe graph has a horizontal axis labeled \"Quantity\" and a vertical axis labeled \"Price\". The supply curve is a line that passes through the origin and slopes upward. The point on the graph where the supply curve intersects the vertical axis is called the \"equilibrium price\". The equilibrium price is the price at which the quantity of a product that producers are willing and able to supply is equal to the quantity of that product that consumers are willing and able to buy.\n\nThe graph also has two other lines labeled P1 and P2. These lines are parallel to the supply curve and represent different price levels. The line P1 is above the supply curve, and the line P2 is below the supply curve. The line P1 represents a price level that is higher than the equilibrium price, and the line P2 represents a price level that is lower than the equilibrium price.\n\nAt the price level P1, there is a surplus of the product. This means that the quantity of the product that producers are willing and able to supply is greater than the quantity of the product that consumers are willing and able to buy. This will cause the price of the product to fall until it reaches the equilibrium price.\n\nAt the price level P2, there is a shortage of the product. This means that the quantity of the product that producers are willing and able to supply is less than the quantity of the product that consumers are willing and able to buy. This will cause the price of the product to rise until it reaches the equilibrium price.
